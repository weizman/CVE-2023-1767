## Vendor

[Snyk](https://snyk.io)

## Product

[Snyk Advisor](https://snyk.io/advisor/)

## Vulnerability Type

Stored XSS on `snyk.io` domain

## Title

Markdown sanitazation of README.md files of npm packages displayed by Snyk Advisor is lacking, resulting in a potential for storing an XSS exploit

## Description

Markdown format accepts HTML tags by default according to the official Markdown specification. 
However, HTML tags can result in JavaScript code execution. 
Therefore, when parsing Markdown content into HTML and integrating it into a web application, it can result in XSS.
This is the case for Snyk's Advisor service which displays Markdown content of differet npm packages which they control without any protection against XSS.

## Impact

[Medium CVSS score](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N&version=3.1) and potentially higher.

### Proven impact

As thoroughly described and demonstrated in the complimentary [blog post](../README.md), 
an attacker can use this XSS to completely fabricate the health score granted by the Advisor and make a package they control seem 
legit and widely addopted when in fact that's far from being true. 

Consider the following steps:

1. Attacker creates a new npm package called `html2pdf`.
2. Attacker edits the README of the package to look legit but also injects an XSS payload.
3. Snyk Advisor scans the new package and displays it at https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/html2pdf
4. Attacker publishes a new version with a more advanced payload, that when is executed in the https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package app, changes its layout completely to pose as a healthy, highly maintained and widely addopted package (by simply modifying the HTML of the app on-the-fly)
5. Snyk Advisor scans the new version, so now whenever someone's visiting https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/html2pdf, the payload will load and the package will look legit.
6. Attacker promotes the package as an html-to-pdf converter service, specifically with the Snyk Advisor link, so that people will be convinced the package is good for use.
7. Since the Advisor layout confirms the package is legit, the victim will consider using it.
8. The fact the Advisor suggests to copy the `npm install html2pdf` command makes it worse - no reason for the victim to visit the npm package over at https://npmjs.com, where they could have found out the package is not what it appears to be by the advisor.
9. Victim installs the malicious package after counting on Snyk Advisor without knowing it is in fact far from being healthy, and is in fact malicious.
