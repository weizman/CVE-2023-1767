# Part 1 - Markdown to XSS!

## Markdown

We all know and love [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/#what-is-markdown)! 

I personally use Markdown format for almost everything I write (including this post). 
I find it light yet powerful, clean and aesthetic.

It's also fun to use because of it being widely adopted by the tools and platforms we mainly depend on, most dominant ones being [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlub.com/).

But here's the surprising part - GitHub and GitLab aren't working with Markdown exactly. Allow me to explain.

## GFM and GLFM

Both GitHub and GitLab have their own flavoured versions of Markdown. 
Those versions simply introduce features and extensions to the original Markdown format to make it more powerful and rich for use.

[GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (stands for "GitHub Flavored Markdown") and [GLFM](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html) (stands for "GitLab Flavored Markdown") introduce some extra purks with which users can express more than just plain text.

The specification for Markdown is openly accessible via [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/), and both GFM and GLFM extend it.
