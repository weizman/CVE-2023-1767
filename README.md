## Supply chain security - an intro

Supply chain security is something we constantly hear of in the past years, and for a good reason.
We build our softwares on top of a long chain of dependencies that we don't control and that change frequently,
so just trusting them to be legitimate in the long run is not something we can afford.

That's why in the past few years we see more and more attempts to produce products that attempt to secure against that problem specifically.

There are a number of ways attackers can leverage your need for building your software on top of third party dependencies:

### 1. Compromising an already-used legitimate package

One thing attackers tend to do is to find a third party package that is being used by a vendor they wish to attack, and then take control over it.
Once control is gained, the attacker can push a new version to that package, introducing the exploit they wish to bring across your application.

At this point, it's likely that the vendor will eventually update their dependencies to their newer versions, thus potentially pulling the compromised version of the breached dependency without even being aware of that.

### 2. Luring to use a yet-to-be-used malicious package

Another thing attackers might do is to publish a new dependency they control and make it look like it does legitimate stuff, then try to lure developers into installing those in their projects. Once they do, the package which isn't actually legitimate can compromise the software.

However, this requires some level of sophistication, because you have to convince the developer, a human being, that your package is legitimate and trustworthy - and that is a hard task considering the level of awareness developers have for the potential damage that lies in using a new and unfamiliar package.
