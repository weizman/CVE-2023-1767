## Supply chain security - an intro

Supply chain security is something we constantly hear of in the past years, and for a good reason.
We build our softwares on top of a long chain of dependencies that we don't control and that change frequently,
so just trusting them to be legitimate in the long run is not something we can work with.

That's why in the past few years we see more and more attempts to produce products that attempt to secure against that problem specifically.

There are a number of ways attackers can leverage your need for building your software on top of third party dependencies, here are two main ones:

### 1. Compromising an already-used legitimate package

One thing attackers tend to do is to find a third party package that is being used by a vendor they wish to attack, and then take control over it.
Once control is gained, the attacker can push a new version to that package, introducing the exploit they wish to bring across your application.

At this point, it's likely that the vendor will eventually update their dependencies to their newer versions, thus potentially pulling the compromised version of the breached dependency without even being aware of that.

### 2. Luring to use a yet-to-be-used malicious package

Another thing attackers might do is to publish a new dependency they control and make it look like it does legitimate stuff, then try to lure developers into installing those in their projects. Once they do, the package which isn't actually legitimate, can compromise the software.

However, this requires some level of sophistication, because you have to convince the developer, a human being, that your package is legitimate and trustworthy - and that is a hard task considering the level of awareness developers have for the potential damage that lies in using a new and unfamiliar package.

Let's elaborate on that.

## Luring developers is hard!

Because of the growing concern that evolves around supply chain attacks, developers are more aware of the problem and make sure to be able to tell the difference between a legitimate package and a suspicious one.

So what actions do developers take when considering installing a new package?

Here's a perfect answer to the question `How do I verify an npm package is legitimate to use or not before installing it?
` by the amazing ChatGPT!

> _"1. Check the package's popularity and reputation: Check how many downloads and stars the package has received. If a package has a high number of downloads and positive reviews, it's likely to be legitimate."_

I'd say, this is where you start. A good way to get a general sense of the legitimacy of a package is by understanding how popular and well known it is. It's usually never enough to fully tell its legitimacy, but it does help knowing many people starred it, or even better, recently downloaded and used it.

> _"2. Check the package's dependencies: Look at the package's dependencies and ensure that they are widely used and trustworthy. If the package has dependencies that are rarely used or not well-known, it may be a sign of a potentially insecure package."_

> _"3. Check the package's source code: Review the source code of the package to ensure that it doesn't contain any malicious code. Look for any unusual or suspicious code patterns or functions."_

> _"4. Check the package's maintainers: Verify the package maintainers are legitimate and reputable. Check their online presence and activity, and ensure that they have a good reputation in the development community."_

These are even better ways for telling if a package is trustworthy. Popularity for itself isn't enough, but if you can afford going through its dependencies and maintainers and make sure they're also popular and legit, it would help a lot in making the decision. If you can even afford browsing through its source code that's amazing! But that's unlikely to be something we're going to do.

> _"5. Check the package's license: Make sure that the package has a legitimate and permissive open-source license that allows for reuse and redistribution."_

I'm honestly not sure how's this related, but I had to give ChatGPT the credit for trying ðŸ¤· - although next one is the killer section I was hoping ChatGPT would say (I DID NOT TOUCH THIS - THIS WAS ALL CHATGPT!):

> _"6. Use a package verification tool: There are several tools available that can help you verify the legitimacy of an npm package, such as npm audit or **Snyk**."_

This is the ultimate section that supposed to eliminate the need for all previous sections. 
As I said ealier, due to the concern of the industry, naturally we now have third party services to help us verify the integrity of third party packages instead of having to do the dirty job ourselves.

These products are your one-stop-shop. 

They examine all packages and take into consideration everything mentioned above, such as popularity, usage, amount of recent downloads, integrity of contributers, level of community engagment and even potentially source code static analisys - and they calculate it all into a score, to give you a sense of how legitimate for use that package.

... there are many of those but snyk is the most popular one as chatgpt says
